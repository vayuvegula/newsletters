  "executive_summary": "2025 saw reasoning models become standard practice, dramatically improving AI performance across math, coding, and robotics but at significant computational cost. Meta triggered an unprecedented talent war with packages up to $300M over 4 years, forcing all major players to dramatically increase AI engineer compensation. The industry committed over $300B this year alone to data center buildout, with projections of $5.2T by 2030, representing infrastructure spending at industrial scale.",
